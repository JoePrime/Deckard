## Card ideas
- A card that becomes more powerful the longer the game lasts (include a turn counter!),
maybe +1 attack for every 10 turns. "Self-sharpening blade gets stronger the longer it is in your hand."
- Card with a random power
- Draw two more cards from the deck
- Cards that are more/less powerful depending on your remaining health/armor/mana.
- Card that is more powerful the longer the game has lasted.
- Combo cards
- A card that allows you to sacrifice your hand to hit the opponent for the total mana cost of the cards in your hand. Not sure about the mana cost. If low, the attack is a bit weaker, but the card easier to use. If high, the attack will be more powerful, but the card harder to use.

## Other ideas
- In the beginning of the game you have to choose a faction(color). This gives
you a one-time boost you can use on cards of that color (all cards, or just your own?), to make them cheaper
/more powerful. (Possibly bad idea, would have to remember the color!!!)
- Current mana, mana production, cards for both.
- Have both Health Points and Defense Points. Only losing the Health Points
makes you lose.
- Emphasize high risk/high reward -> More fun?
- 100 health points?
- For attack cards, the attack points/mana points ratio should be high, so that the players' health tends towards zero as the game goes on. For health giving cards, the ratio should be low.
