Start the program by running the jar-file.  
Write the nicknames you want to use to the empty text fields in the Login screen and click the "Start the game!"-button.  

After this you should be seeing the battle view. Close to the upper border in this window can be seen a row of spots (10) for the
cards in the player 1's hand. Near the lower border are the places for player 2's hand's cards. The cards in the hands can be used
on the player's turn. The turns alternate. Using the cards the players can try to reduce their opponent's hitpoints to 0 to win
the game. The cards can be used to increase your own or decrease your opponent health, armor, mana or other resources. Using a card
requires mana, which is a resource of which the players receive every turn an amount equal to their mana production. On every card
can be seen their name, mana cost and description.
  The player's hitpoints, armor, mana and mana production can be seen at the upper
and lower edges of the screen. The counter on the right shows how many turns have passed in the game. On the left is the button
enabling you to skip the turn if you don't want to use any cards.
