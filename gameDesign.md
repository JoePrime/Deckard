## Card ideas
- A card that becomes more powerful the longer the game lasts (include counter),
maybe +1 attack for every 10 turns
- Card with a random power
- Draw two more cards from the deck

## Other ideas
- In the beginning of the game you have to choose a faction(color). This gives
you a one-time boost you can use on cards of that color (all cards, or just your own?), to make them cheaper
/more powerful. (Possibly bad idea, would have to remember the color!!!)
- Current mana, mana productio, cards for both.
- Have both Health Points and Defense Points. Only losing the Health Points
makes you lose.
- Emphasize high risk/high reward -> More fun?
- 100 health points?
